      <div id="C">
        <h1>C</h1>
        <p>C is the OG programming language. First released in 1972 (That's 48 years ago!), this programming language has seen it all and stuck around.</p>
        <p>This is a difficult language to start with for beginners, which will likely mean more time spent figuring out how the language works rather than being able to spend time learning the fundamentals of programming.</p>
        <p>Learning this language is not going to be easy as the syntax is fairly dated, but past that should be pretty straightforward. Plus, learning this language will be a good foundation and base for learning other programming languages. Because it has been around since the beginning, its influence on other programming languages will be noticeable wherever you decide to go next. This aint yo mama's programming language (More like yo grandma's).</p>
      </div>
      <div id="C++">
        <h1>C++</h1>
        <p>C++ is a powerful language that can do many things, but is rather low level, meaning it is more difficult to "read." This means you will spend more time figuring out how the language itself works rather than how programming works.</p> 
        <p>Writing an application from scratch with C++ require a <em>lot</em> of code and is more difficult to manage. However, C++ is good at what it does and is often used for very resource intensive programs like AAA games. C++ is a good choice for computer software, mobile apps, video games, game engines, or even web applications.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="C#">
        <h1>C#</h1>
        <p>C# (pronounced C-sharp) was developed by Microsoft for their .NET framework and is based on C and C++. It was designed to be simple and straightforward, which makes it an easier language to start on.</p>
        <p>A high-level language (though not quite as high-level as, say, Python), it is designed to be easy to read, and the language itself takes care of a lot of the abstracts behind the scenes so your computer can deal with the code.</p>
        <p>C# is the primary programming language of Microsoft and is also popular with game developers, so if you are interested in working for/with Microsoft, or getting into game development to use things like the Unity engine, this may be the language for you!</p>
      </div>
      <div id="CSS">
        <h1>CSS</h1>
        <p>CSS (which stands for Cascading Styles Sheets) is the language many web designers and web developers use for the look and design of their websites. If HTML is the foundation and framework of a house, CSS is the siding, style, and paintjob. Together with javascript, these 3 language form the trinity of web development.</p>
        <p>CSS is not considered by many to be a "proper" coding language, but nonetheless is essential in web development. If you are interested in building websites, CSS will be required. Luckily, CSS is a quick and easy language to learn the basics of, and is great for beginners because you can see your work immediately.</p>
        <p>Another thing that makes CSS great is that you can learn enough in a few weeks to start picking up side jobs to practice and earn a little money on the side while you continue learning other languages, which will help pay the bills as well as deepen your portfolio for landing that entry-level front-end developer job down the road.</p>

        <h1>Java</h1>
        <p>Java is one of the most widely used and most popular programming languages in the world right now. It can be used for many types of applications, from mobile apps to entire desktop applications. As of June 2020, it had fallen to second place to C in the <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">TIOBE Index</a>.</p>

        <h1>HTML</h1>
        <p>HTML (or Hypertext Markup Language) is used to create all websites and is the essential structural and content component of said sites. While HTML is also not technically a full "programming language," but a markup language, HTML is arguably the most important part of web development. The basics are very simple to learn and it is a great jumpoff point to coding and web development.Together with CSS and Javascript, you will be able to create some pretty amazing website.</p>
